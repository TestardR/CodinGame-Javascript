/** Defibrillators (easy) https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators
 * This puzzle makes you split a string into substrings, replace a character of
 * a string and convert it into floats. You also have to convert degrees into
 * radians and use mathematical operations like square root or cosinus.
 * Finally you have to apply multiple computations (addition, multiplication...)
 * on floating numbers.
 *
 * Statement:
 * The goal of this exercise is to make you find the closest point to given
 * geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Your program must print the
 * associated location name.
 * In this puzzle you will play a lot with conversion (degree to radian,
 * coordinates to distance, string to float).
 *
 * Story:
 * Want to save lives? Good! So help us find the closest defibrillator from a
 * given position in the city of Montpellier, France.
